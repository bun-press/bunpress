# Product Context

## Vision Statement

BunPress is a modern, high-performance static site generator and fullstack framework built specifically for the Bun JavaScript runtime. It aims to combine the speed and simplicity of static site generators with the flexibility of fullstack frameworks, providing a seamless development experience for content-rich websites and applications.

## Problem Statement

Existing static site generators and fullstack frameworks face several challenges:

1. **Performance Trade-offs**: Static site generators are fast at runtime but slow during development. Fullstack frameworks provide dynamic capabilities but at the cost of runtime performance.

2. **Complexity**: Many frameworks require extensive configuration or knowledge of complex ecosystems, creating a steep learning curve.

3. **Limited Flexibility**: Static generators often lack dynamic capabilities, while fullstack frameworks can be overkill for content-focused sites.

4. **Runtime Limitations**: Few frameworks are optimized for modern JavaScript runtimes like Bun, missing opportunities for significant performance improvements.

5. **Plugin Fragmentation**: Plugin ecosystems often become fragmented and inconsistent, leading to compatibility issues and maintenance challenges.

BunPress addresses these challenges by leveraging Bun's capabilities to create a unified approach that combines static and dynamic features with exceptional performance.
