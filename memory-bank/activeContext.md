7. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Resolved TypeScript errors in the theme layouts (DocLayout, HomeLayout, and PageLayout) by removing unused `description` variable declarations.

8. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with version information and recent changes
   - Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md with more detailed project structure and development workflow
   - Improved README.md with detailed usage instructions and examples
   - Created a comprehensive user guide (bunpress-user-guide.md) in the memory bank

9. **Next Steps**:
