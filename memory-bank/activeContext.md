# Active Context

## Current Focus: Test Quality & Cross-Platform Compatibility

Our immediate focus has shifted to improving test quality while maintaining cross-platform compatibility:

1. **Test Quality Improvements** üîÑ
   - Replacing mocked test cases with real implementations
   - Adding proper DOM testing environment for React components
   - Enhancing test coverage for core functionality
   - Implementing end-to-end testing for critical paths

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Path resolution issues in Windows environments require attention
   - Path normalization inconsistencies between development and build
   - Need consistent approach to handling file paths across platforms

3. **Performance Optimization** üîÑ
   - Bundler performance needs improvement for large projects
   - CSS module scoping in hybrid mode requires fixes
   - Need to implement asset caching and incremental builds

## Recent Test Improvements ‚úÖ

We've successfully completed several testing improvements:

1. **Slot System Tests** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented DOM testing with Happy DOM
   - Added proper React 18 testing support
   - Created comprehensive test suite covering all slot system features
   - Included dynamic tests for content changes

2. **CSS Processor Tests** ‚úÖ
   - Replaced mocked Bun.build with real implementation
   - Added tests with real CSS files and filesystem operations
   - Improved URL rewriting tests
   - Enhanced test coverage for minification

3. **HMR System Tests** ‚úÖ
   - Improved tests for hot module replacement
   - Enhanced WebSocket testing
   - Fixed reliability issues in tests
   - Added tests for module dependencies

4. **Bundler Tests** ‚úÖ
   - Created real-world asset bundling tests
   - Added HTML processing with asset extraction tests
   - Implemented proper cleanup for test files
   - Added testing for HMR script injection

## Core Features Status

1. **Fullstack Capabilities** ‚úÖ
   - Fullstack server with Bun.serve is fully implemented
   - HTML imports with custom `<import-html>` tags working
   - API route handling is operational
   - Static file serving is implemented
   - Custom route handlers with RegExp patterns are working

2. **Theme System** ‚úÖ
   - Slot system for content injection is fully implemented and tested
   - Component layouts (DocLayout, HomeLayout, PageLayout) are complete
   - Navigation, sidebar, TOC, and footer components working
   - Theme customization via configuration options implemented

3. **Plugin Architecture** ‚úÖ
   - Plugin system with lifecycle hooks (buildStart, transform, buildEnd) implemented
   - Plugin manager for registration and execution working
   - Built-in plugins for core functionality available
   - Interface for creating custom plugins documented

## Next Steps

1. **Test Quality Priority Tasks**
   - Complete the refactoring of remaining mocked tests
   - Implement cross-platform test validation
   - Improve test coverage for edge cases
   - Add more comprehensive error handling tests

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Tasks**
   - Create a unified path handling utility for cross-platform compatibility
   - Implement consistent path normalization across the codebase
   - Add tests specifically for Windows path handling
   - Replace string path manipulation with path module functions

3. **Performance Optimization Tasks**
   - Implement incremental build support to avoid redundant processing
   - Add asset caching for faster rebuilds
   - Optimize CSS module scoping in hybrid mode
   - Add parallel processing for content transformation
