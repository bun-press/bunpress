# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently expanding the BunPress plugin ecosystem to provide valuable functionality for users. The focus is on developing useful plugins that demonstrate the flexibility and power of the plugin system.

### Image Optimization Plugin

We just implemented an image optimization plugin for BunPress that:

1. Converts images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) for better performance
2. Generates multiple sizes for responsive images
3. Reduces file size while maintaining quality
4. Automatically updates image references in content

This plugin demonstrates how BunPress plugins can:
- Hook into the build process (buildStart, buildEnd)
- Transform content (markdown/HTML)
- Process assets
- Provide helpful user feedback

The plugin is configurable, allowing users to specify:
- Input/output directories
- Image formats and quality settings
- Size variants to generate
- File extensions to process
- Whether to keep original files

### Recent Changes

1. Created the core plugin system with interfaces and lifecycle hooks
2. Implemented the default plugin manager
3. Created the image optimization plugin using sharp
4. Added plugin documentation and examples
5. Created tests for the plugin
6. Updated the plugin registry

### Current Decisions

1. **Plugin First Approach**: We're emphasizing a plugin-based architecture to make BunPress highly extensible.
2. **Modern Image Formats**: The image optimizer defaults to WebP for better web performance.
3. **Bun-First Development**: All tools and plugins are optimized for Bun's runtime.
4. **Developer Experience**: Focusing on making plugins intuitive to use with sensible defaults.

## Next Steps

1. Develop more essential plugins:
   - SEO optimization plugin
   - Sitemap generation
   - RSS feed generator
   - Search functionality

2. Improve plugin documentation:
   - Create a plugin development guide
   - Add more examples
   - Document best practices

3. Enhance plugin system:
   - Add plugin dependency resolution
   - Implement validation and error handling
   - Create plugin conflict detection

4. User Experience:
   - Improve CLI commands for working with plugins
   - Add plugin discovery and installation commands
   - Create interactive plugin configuration tools

## Current Status
- Plugin system core implementation completed
- Markdown-it plugin example created and tested
- Prism.js syntax highlighting plugin implemented
- Content processor integrated with plugin system
- Build system integrated with plugin lifecycle hooks
- Project structure cleaned up (removed unused files and directories)
- Configuration system updated to support plugin loading
- NPM package configuration completed
  - Package.json updated with proper metadata and exports
  - Binary executable for CLI usage
  - Type definitions and declaration files setup
  - Project initialization command added

## Recent Decisions
1. Implemented the plugin system with an async/await approach for all hooks
2. Created a flexible interface for plugins with lifecycle hooks
3. Designed a plugin manager for centralized plugin management
4. Used Markdown-it and Prism.js as example plugins
5. Integrated plugins with the content processor and build system
6. Added plugin configuration support in bunpress.config.ts
7. Cleaned up project structure for better organization
8. Added build command with plugin integration
9. Configured package.json for npm publishing
10. Created helper functions for plugin and config definitions
11. Added project initialization command

## Active Considerations
1. **Plugin Integration**: Best practices for integrating plugins with build process
2. **Plugin Discovery**: Methods for automatic plugin discovery and loading
3. **Plugin Configuration**: How to handle plugin configuration through bunpress.config.ts
4. **Plugin Dependencies**: Managing dependencies between plugins
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of plugin failures
6. **NPM Package**: Ensuring the package is optimized for Bun-first usage

## Blockers and Challenges
- Need to ensure plugin execution order is maintained for content transformations
- Need to handle errors in plugin execution gracefully
- Need to consider performance implications of multiple transform hooks
- Need to properly handle async operations in build process
- Need to ensure the package works correctly when installed globally

## Areas Requiring Investigation
1. Best practices for plugin hook execution ordering
2. Optimal strategies for plugin configuration validation
3. Error handling approaches for plugin failures
4. Performance optimization of plugin-based transformations
5. Testing the package in real-world scenarios
