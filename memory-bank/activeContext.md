   - Enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md with more detailed project structure and development workflow
   - Improved README.md with detailed usage instructions and examples
   - Created a comprehensive user guide (bunpress-user-guide.md) in the memory bank

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Complete the internationalization (i18n) plugin implementation
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage for CLI commands
   - Enhance the theme system with more customization options
   - Create a comprehensive documentation site

We are currently working on implementing the internationalization (i18n) plugin for BunPress to provide multilingual support for content.

### Internationalization (i18n) Plugin

We are developing an internationalization plugin for BunPress that will:

1. Support multiple locales with configurable default language
2. Load translations from JSON files
3. Allow for inline translation in content using a simple syntax like `{{t:key}}`
4. Generate locale-specific routes (e.g., /en/about, /fr/about)
5. Provide a fallback mechanism for missing translations
6. Support nested translation keys for better organization

Progress on the i18n plugin implementation:
- Created the i18n Plugin class with type-safe options
- Implemented translation loading from JSON files
- Added automatic creation of sample translation files
- Implemented retrieval of translations with nested key support
- Added fallback to default locale for missing translations
- Implemented content transformation for replacing {{t:key}} syntax
- Added support for locale specification in frontmatter
- Added fallback text support with {{t:key|default}} syntax
- Created comprehensive tests for all functionality

Remaining work on the i18n plugin:
- Implement locale-specific route generation
- Add support for programmatic use in themes
- Integrate with content processor for automatic route generation
- Complete test coverage for all features

The i18n plugin demonstrates:
- Integration with the content processing pipeline
- Route generation based on configured locales
- Transformation of content with translations
- Exposing utility functions for programmatic use
- Proper testing with mock translations

### Analytics Plugin

We've implemented an analytics plugin for BunPress that:

1. Provides support for multiple analytics services (Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Fathom, Plausible, Umami)
2. Automatically injects the appropriate script tags into HTML output
3. Respects development mode with optional inclusion
4. Allows custom analytics code integration
5. Includes comprehensive test coverage

The analytics plugin demonstrates:
- Using the transform hook to modify HTML content
- Environment-aware behavior (development vs. production)
- Supporting multiple service providers with a unified interface
- Type-safe configuration options
- Proper testing with mocked HTML content

### Theme System

We've implemented a theme system that:

1. Supports custom themes with customizable layouts and styles
2. Integrates with Shadcn UI components
3. Allows for theme configuration via bunpress.config.ts
4. Provides fallback to a default theme when needed
5. Includes proper testing of theme loading and application

The theme system implementation demonstrates:
- Using a manager pattern to handle theme loading and configuration
- Integrating with the renderer for HTML output
- Supporting theme options for customization
- Properly handling missing themes with graceful fallbacks
- Using TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

### RSS Feed Plugin

We've just implemented an RSS feed plugin for BunPress that:

1. Generates an XML feed of content for syndication
2. Supports configurable options: title, description, site URL, and copyright information
3. Allows customization of feed language, item limit, and output filename
4. Properly escapes XML special characters
5. Generates content excerpts for feed items
6. Ensures complete test coverage with mock file system operations

The RSS feed plugin demonstrates:
- Using the buildEnd lifecycle hook to generate files at the end of the build process
- Transforming content metadata into a different format (XML)
- Exposing test helpers through a dedicated interface for proper testing
- Implementing proper type safety with interfaces and type assertions

### Router Testing

We've also completed implementing comprehensive tests for the router module. This ensures that the file-based routing system is working correctly and handles various edge cases appropriately. The router tests verify:

1. Route generation from a simple directory structure
2. Handling of empty directories
3. Handling of directories without markdown files
4. Asynchronous route generation
5. Support for MDX files

The router testing implementation:
- Uses mock implementations for file system operations to avoid test flakiness
- Tests both synchronous and asynchronous routing functions
- Ensures mocks are properly scoped and restored to avoid affecting other tests
- Verifies route generation logic with different file structures

This work completes the core testing infrastructure for the essential components of BunPress.

### SEO Plugin

We previously implemented an SEO optimization plugin for BunPress that:

1. Adds OpenGraph meta tags for better social media sharing
2. Adds Twitter Card meta tags for better Twitter sharing
3. Generates a robots.txt file
4. Generates a sitemap.xml file
5. Adds canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
6. Supports schema.org JSON-LD structured data (optional)

This plugin demonstrates additional capabilities of the BunPress plugin system:
- Content transformation to add meta tags to HTML
- File generation using plugin hooks
- Metadata extraction and processing
- Configuration options with sensible defaults
- End-of-build processing with the buildEnd hook

### Image Optimization Plugin

Previously, we implemented an image optimization plugin for BunPress that:

1. Converts images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) for better performance
2. Generates multiple sizes for responsive images
3. Reduces file size while maintaining quality
4. Automatically updates image references in content

This plugin demonstrates how BunPress plugins can:
- Hook into the build process (buildStart, buildEnd)
- Transform content (markdown/HTML)
- Process assets
- Provide helpful user feedback

The plugin is configurable, allowing users to specify:
- Input/output directories
- Image formats and quality settings
- Size variants to generate
- File extensions to process
- Whether to keep original files
