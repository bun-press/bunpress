# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing the plugin system with core interfaces and manager
- Creating example plugins to demonstrate extensibility
- Integrating the plugin system with the content processor and build system
- Cleaning up project structure

## Current Status
- Plugin system core implementation completed
- Markdown-it plugin example created and tested
- Prism.js syntax highlighting plugin implemented
- Content processor integrated with plugin system
- Build system integrated with plugin lifecycle hooks
- Project structure cleaned up (removed unused files and directories)
- Configuration system updated to support plugin loading

## Recent Decisions
1. Implemented the plugin system with an async/await approach for all hooks
2. Created a flexible interface for plugins with lifecycle hooks
3. Designed a plugin manager for centralized plugin management
4. Used Markdown-it and Prism.js as example plugins
5. Integrated plugins with the content processor and build system
6. Added plugin configuration support in bunpress.config.ts
7. Cleaned up project structure for better organization
8. Added build command with plugin integration

## Active Considerations
1. **Plugin Integration**: Best practices for integrating plugins with build process
2. **Plugin Discovery**: Methods for automatic plugin discovery and loading
3. **Plugin Configuration**: How to handle plugin configuration through bunpress.config.ts
4. **Plugin Dependencies**: Managing dependencies between plugins
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of plugin failures

## Next Steps
1. Create more example plugins (image optimization, SEO, sitemap)
2. Add plugin validation and error handling
3. Implement plugin dependency resolution
4. Create comprehensive plugin documentation with examples
5. Add more tests for build system with plugins

## Blockers and Challenges
- Need to ensure plugin execution order is maintained for content transformations
- Need to handle errors in plugin execution gracefully
- Need to consider performance implications of multiple transform hooks
- Need to properly handle async operations in build process

## Areas Requiring Investigation
1. Best practices for plugin hook execution ordering
2. Optimal strategies for plugin configuration validation
3. Error handling approaches for plugin failures
4. Performance optimization of plugin-based transformations
