# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on comprehensive testing of core functionality and expanding the BunPress plugin ecosystem to provide valuable functionality for users.

### RSS Feed Plugin

We've just implemented an RSS feed plugin for BunPress that:

1. Generates an XML feed of content for syndication
2. Supports configurable options: title, description, site URL, and copyright information
3. Allows customization of feed language, item limit, and output filename
4. Properly escapes XML special characters
5. Generates content excerpts for feed items
6. Ensures complete test coverage with mock file system operations

The RSS feed plugin demonstrates:
- Using the buildEnd lifecycle hook to generate files at the end of the build process
- Transforming content metadata into a different format (XML)
- Exposing test helpers through a dedicated interface for proper testing
- Implementing proper type safety with interfaces and type assertions

### Router Testing

We've also completed implementing comprehensive tests for the router module. This ensures that the file-based routing system is working correctly and handles various edge cases appropriately. The router tests verify:

1. Route generation from a simple directory structure
2. Handling of empty directories
3. Handling of directories without markdown files
4. Asynchronous route generation
5. Support for MDX files

The router testing implementation:
- Uses mock implementations for file system operations to avoid test flakiness
- Tests both synchronous and asynchronous routing functions
- Ensures mocks are properly scoped and restored to avoid affecting other tests
- Verifies route generation logic with different file structures

This work completes the core testing infrastructure for the essential components of BunPress.

### SEO Plugin

We previously implemented an SEO optimization plugin for BunPress that:

1. Adds OpenGraph meta tags for better social media sharing
2. Adds Twitter Card meta tags for better Twitter sharing
3. Generates a robots.txt file
4. Generates a sitemap.xml file
5. Adds canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues
6. Supports schema.org JSON-LD structured data (optional)

This plugin demonstrates additional capabilities of the BunPress plugin system:
- Content transformation to add meta tags to HTML
- File generation using plugin hooks
- Metadata extraction and processing
- Configuration options with sensible defaults
- End-of-build processing with the buildEnd hook

### Image Optimization Plugin

Previously, we implemented an image optimization plugin for BunPress that:

1. Converts images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) for better performance
2. Generates multiple sizes for responsive images
3. Reduces file size while maintaining quality
4. Automatically updates image references in content

This plugin demonstrates how BunPress plugins can:
- Hook into the build process (buildStart, buildEnd)
- Transform content (markdown/HTML)
- Process assets
- Provide helpful user feedback

The plugin is configurable, allowing users to specify:
- Input/output directories
- Image formats and quality settings
- Size variants to generate
- File extensions to process
- Whether to keep original files

### Recent Changes

1. Implemented the RSS feed plugin with configurable options and proper testing
2. Fixed testing isolation issues between router tests and other components
3. Added type declarations for plugin test helpers to ensure type safety
4. Updated the plugins index and configuration example with RSS feed plugin
5. Implemented comprehensive tests for all plugins
6. Fixed issues with content processor testing
7. Improved plugin type definitions for better developer experience

### Current Decisions

1. **Plugin First Approach**: We're emphasizing a plugin-based architecture to make BunPress highly extensible.
2. **Modern Image Formats**: The image optimizer defaults to WebP for better web performance.
3. **Bun-First Development**: All tools and plugins are optimized for Bun's runtime.
4. **Developer Experience**: Focusing on making plugins intuitive to use with sensible defaults.
5. **Combined Functionality**: Some plugins like SEO combine multiple related features (e.g., meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt).
6. **Test Isolation**: Using proper mocking techniques to ensure tests don't interfere with each other.
7. **Test Helpers**: Exposing test helpers through a `__test__` property for plugins that generate content.

## Next Steps

1. Develop more essential plugins:
   - Search functionality
   - Analytics integration

2. Improve plugin documentation:
   - Create a plugin development guide
   - Add more examples
   - Document best practices

3. Enhance plugin system:
   - Add plugin dependency resolution
   - Implement validation and error handling
   - Create plugin conflict detection

4. User Experience:
   - Improve CLI commands for working with plugins
   - Add plugin discovery and installation commands
   - Create interactive plugin configuration tools

## Current Status
- Plugin system core implementation completed
- Markdown-it plugin example created and tested
- Prism.js syntax highlighting plugin implemented
- Image optimization plugin implemented and tested
- SEO optimization plugin implemented and tested
- RSS feed plugin implemented and tested
- Content processor integrated with plugin system
- Build system integrated with plugin lifecycle hooks
- All core components have comprehensive test coverage
- Router implementation fully tested with mock file system
- Project structure cleaned up (removed unused files and directories)
- Configuration system updated to support plugin loading
- NPM package configuration completed
  - Package.json updated with proper metadata and exports
  - Binary executable for CLI usage
  - Type definitions and declaration files setup
  - Project initialization command added

## Recent Decisions
1. Used mock implementations for file system operations in router tests
2. Ensured tests are isolated to prevent interference
3. Standardized testing patterns across the codebase
4. Focused on completing core test coverage before adding new features
5. Implemented targeted mocking to minimize side effects between tests
6. Added a type extension pattern for test helpers to maintain type safety

## Active Considerations
1. **Plugin Integration**: Best practices for integrating plugins with build process
2. **Plugin Discovery**: Methods for automatic plugin discovery and loading
3. **Plugin Configuration**: How to handle plugin configuration through bunpress.config.ts
4. **Plugin Dependencies**: Managing dependencies between plugins
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of plugin failures
6. **NPM Package**: Ensuring the package is optimized for Bun-first usage
7. **Testing**: Ensuring all components have proper test coverage with mock implementations
8. **Test Patterns**: Standardizing test patterns and mocking approaches
9. **Type Safety**: Balancing type safety with developer convenience in plugin interfaces

## Blockers and Challenges
- Need to ensure plugin execution order is maintained for content transformations
- Need to handle errors in plugin execution gracefully
- Need to consider performance implications of multiple transform hooks
- Need to properly handle async operations in build process
- Need to ensure the package works correctly when installed globally
- Need to maintain proper test isolation when mocking shared dependencies
- Need to design plugin type interfaces that are both safe and convenient

## Areas Requiring Investigation
1. Best practices for plugin hook execution ordering
2. Optimal strategies for plugin configuration validation
3. Error handling approaches for plugin failures
4. Performance optimization of plugin-based transformations
5. Testing the package in real-world scenarios
6. Alternative mocking approaches for complex systems
7. Type-safe patterns for plugin testing
