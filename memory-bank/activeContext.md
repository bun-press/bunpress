# Active Context for BunPress

## Current Focus
The current focus for BunPress is to clean up the project structure and improve test reliability by removing unnecessary files and directories, optimizing dependencies, and making tests more isolated. We're also working on TypeScript compatibility improvements, theme integration enhancements, cross-platform compatibility, and performance optimization.

### Project Cleanup
We've identified several issues in the project:
1. There were many unnecessary files that were only for testing purposes (test-input, test-project)
2. There were redundant dependencies not being used
3. Some interfaces were not properly defined to match their usage
4. The tests had external dependencies which made them brittle

To address these issues, we've:
1. Created a comprehensive cleanup script (`cleanup-project.js`) to remove unnecessary files and directories
2. Removed unnecessary dependencies from package.json
3. Improved router tests to create test files programmatically instead of depending on files in the repository
4. Updated interface definitions to match their usage
5. Added the `deepclean` script to package.json for easy execution of the cleanup process

### Test Improvements
The router tests were updated to be self-contained by:
1. Creating test files programmatically within the tests
2. Setting up a dedicated test directory that's cleaned up after tests run
3. Avoiding dependencies on external files in the repository

This approach ensures tests are more reliable, isolated, and don't leave artifacts in the repository.

### TypeScript Compatibility Improvements
- ✅ Fixed JSX in .ts files by renaming to .tsx
- ✅ Resolved type declaration issues in the codebase
- ✅ Created missing type definitions
- ✅ Implemented TypeScript checking script with appropriate flags
- Improve typing for theme components and plugins
- Add JSDoc comments to improve editor hints and documentation

### Theme Integration Enhancements
- ✅ Fix theme manager and theme registry tests to ensure proper theme loading and registration
- ✅ Enhance end-to-end CLI test suite with comprehensive theme integration tests
- Improve theme documentation with more examples and usage patterns
- Create additional theme components for common use cases

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure consistent path resolution across Windows and Unix-based systems
- Fix path separator issues in file handling utilities
- Implement platform-agnostic file operations across the codebase

### Performance Optimization
- Improve bundler performance for large sites
- Implement asset caching for faster rebuilds
- Optimize React server component rendering

## Current Status
All tests are now passing (181 tests across 31 files) and the project structure is cleaner and more maintainable.

## Next Steps
1. Continue improving test isolation for other test files that might rely on external files
2. Complete the TypeScript interface improvements throughout the codebase
3. Document the plugin API comprehensively
4. Add linting and pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality
5. Improve typing coverage across the codebase
6. Add JSDoc comments for better documentation
7. Set up stricter TypeScript checks for production builds
8. Add support for theme extension and inheritance
9. Fix path handling inconsistencies for cross-platform compatibility

## Active Decisions
1. Prefer self-contained tests that create their own test files and clean up afterward
2. Remove unnecessary test directories and files to keep the repository clean
3. Maintain comprehensive documentation of cleanup processes in .Cursorrules
4. Be careful when updating interfaces to ensure backward compatibility

## Recent Changes
1. Created a deep cleanup script (`cleanup-project.js`)
2. Removed test-input, test-project, examples, and fix directories
3. Improved router tests to be self-contained
4. Updated interface definitions for theme components
5. Added new cleanups to the progress report and .Cursorrules
