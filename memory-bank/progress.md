   - Complete internationalization (i18n) plugin
   - Advanced syntax highlighting features

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Improve debugging tools
   - Create a development server with hot reloading
   - Enhance the CLI with more helpful commands and better error messages

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation site
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Create plugin development guide

4. **Optimization**:
   - Implement build caching
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Improve development server performance

## Known Issues

1. **Development Mode**: Development server needs more reliable hot-reloading.
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more helpful and specific.
3. **TypeScript Types**: Some type definitions could be improved for better developer experience.
