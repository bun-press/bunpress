## In Progress

1. **Documentation**: ðŸ”„ Documentation needs to be expanded for all features and APIs.
2. **Error Handling**: ðŸ”„ Need to improve error handling and user-friendly error messages.
3. **Performance Optimization**: ðŸ”„ Optimize performance for large content sets.
4. **Advanced Plugins**: ðŸ”„ More plugins to enhance functionality.
5. **Internationalization (i18n)**: ðŸ”„ Implemented basic plugin structure and translation loading. Still need to implement route generation.
6. **CLI Testing**: ðŸ”„ Added basic CLI tests, but need more comprehensive test coverage for CLI commands.

## Recent Achievements

     - âœ… Implement fallback mechanism for missing translations
     - âœ… Add test coverage with mock translations
     - â¬œ Create example usage documentation
     - â¬œ Add plugin to main exports
   - Implement additional advanced plugins

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Fix skipped content processor test
   - Add more comprehensive CLI tests for each command
   - Improve test isolation with better mocking strategies

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Improve debugging tools
   - Create a development server with hot reloading
   - Enhance the CLI with more helpful commands and better error messages

4. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation site
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Create plugin development guide

5. **Optimization**:
   - Implement build caching
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Improve development server performance

## Known Issues

1. **Development Mode**: Development server needs more reliable hot-reloading.
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more helpful and specific.
3. **TypeScript Types**: Some type definitions could be improved for better developer experience.
