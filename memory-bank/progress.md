# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Structure**: âœ… The structure follows a logical organization with clear separation of concerns.
2. **Core Components**: âœ… The core components for processing content, building sites, and serving content are implemented.
3. **Plugin System**: âœ… Plugin architecture allows for extensibility with a well-defined interface.
4. **Config System**: âœ… Configuration system allows for flexible project configuration.
5. **CLI Interface**: âœ… Basic CLI commands work for project initialization and development.
6. **Basic Styling**: âœ… Tailwind CSS integration is working for styling.
7. **Content Loading**: âœ… Markdown content loading and processing pipeline is functional.
8. **Routing**: âœ… Basic routing for content pages is implemented.
9. **Testing**: âœ… Testing framework is set up with key unit tests.
10. **Plugin System**: âœ… Plugin system is fully operational with hooks for build lifecycle and content transformation.
11. **Image Optimization**: âœ… Image optimizer plugin added with capabilities for format conversion, resizing, and compression.

## In Progress

1. **Documentation**: ðŸ”„ Documentation needs to be expanded for all features and APIs.
2. **Error Handling**: ðŸ”„ Need to improve error handling and user-friendly error messages.
3. **Performance Optimization**: ðŸ”„ Optimize performance for large content sets.
4. **Advanced Plugins**: ðŸ”„ More plugins to enhance functionality (search, sitemap, SEO, etc.).

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Plugins**: Create more plugins to enhance functionality:
   - Search indexing plugin
   - SEO optimization plugin
   - Sitemap generation plugin
   - RSS feed generation plugin
   - Syntax highlighting improvements

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Improve debugging tools
   - Create a development server with hot reloading
   - Enhance the CLI with more helpful commands and better error messages

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation site
   - Add more examples and tutorials
   - Create plugin development guide

4. **Optimization**:
   - Implement build caching
   - Optimize asset loading
   - Improve development server performance

## Known Issues

1. **Development Mode**: Development server needs more reliable hot-reloading.
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more helpful and specific.
3. **TypeScript Types**: Some type definitions could be improved for better developer experience.
