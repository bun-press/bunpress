## Bug Fixes

- [x] Fix bundler module loading ordering
- [x] Fix CSS processor stylesheet tracking
- [x] Fix HMR websocket connection
- [x] Fix import.meta.url condition in CLI causing help command to not display correctly - The issue was that `import.meta.url === Bun.main` was evaluating to false because the formats differ (`file:///path` vs `/path`). Fixed by using a more reliable path-based check that handles format differences.
- [x] Fix potential memory leaks in build process - Fixed by implementing a resource tracking system with proper cleanup for file watchers and servers, adding error handling during cleanup operations, and ensuring all resources are properly closed when shutting down.
- [x] Fix dev server auto-reload inconsistencies - Enhanced file watching with better path normalization, implemented more robust handling of file change events, improved debouncing of change events, added better handling of CSS and JS updates, and enhanced WebSocket connection reliability with reconnection logic.
- [ ] Improve error handling for missing templates
- [ ] Fix path resolution issues in Windows environments
- [ ] Address CSS module scoping in hybrid mode
- [ ] Optimize bundler performance for large projects

## Planned Bug Fixes

### Improve Error Handling for Missing Templates

The error handling for missing templates is currently inadequate:
1. Cryptic error messages when templates are not found
2. Lack of suggestions for possible alternatives
3. No graceful fallback to default templates

Planned approach:
- Implement specific error class for template-related errors
- Add helpful suggestions when template names are similar to existing ones
- Create a fallback mechanism to use default templates
- Improve error messages with clear instructions
- Add template validation step during initialization

### Path Resolution in Windows Environments

Path resolution issues in Windows environments need to be addressed:
1. Inconsistent use of path separators causing route mismatches
2. Issues with absolute vs. relative path resolution
3. Case sensitivity differences between Windows and Unix systems

Planned approach:
- Implement consistent path normalization throughout the codebase
- Use path.normalize() and path.resolve() for all path operations
- Convert backslashes to forward slashes for route paths
- Add tests specifically for Windows path handling
- Create a cross-platform path utility for unified path operations

### CSS Module Scoping in Hybrid Mode

CSS module scoping in hybrid mode has the following issues:
1. CSS from HTML and Markdown content can conflict
2. Class name collisions between different components
3. Lack of proper isolation between theme styles and content styles

Planned approach:
- Implement proper CSS module hashing for hybrid mode
- Create scope isolation between theme styles and content styles
- Add namespacing for automatically generated class names
- Implement a style deduplication mechanism for common styles
- Document best practices for CSS organization in hybrid projects

### Bundler Performance Optimization

Performance issues with the bundler for large projects:
1. Excessive memory usage during large builds
2. Slow performance when processing many assets
3. Inefficient file watching causing high CPU usage

Planned approach:
- Implement incremental building for faster rebuilds
- Add asset caching to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
- Use more efficient algorithms for dependency graph generation
- Implement parallel processing where appropriate
- Add performance metrics and monitoring
