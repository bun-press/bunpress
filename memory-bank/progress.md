## Recent Achievements

1. **Slot System Tests**
   - Implemented comprehensive DOM-based tests
   - Used Happy DOM for realistic browser environment
   - Added React 18 testing with createRoot
   - Created dynamic content update tests

2. **CSS Processor Tests**
   - Replaced mocked Bun.build with real implementation
   - Created real CSS files for testing
   - Implemented file-based testing with proper cleanup
   - Added minification and URL rewriting tests

3. **Bundler & HMR Tests**
   - Enhanced real-world asset bundling tests
   - Added tests for HTML processing and asset extraction
   - Fixed WebSocket testing for HMR
   - Improved reliability of HMR tests

## Known Issues

1. **Path Handling**
   - Inconsistent path resolution in Windows environments
   - Path normalization issues between dev and build
   - String manipulation instead of path module functions
   - Absolute vs. relative path inconsistencies

2. **Error Handling**
   - Missing template errors need better messaging
   - Error recovery mechanisms need improvement
   - Validation steps missing in several areas
   - Unclear error attribution (which component caused the error)

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Some tests still using mocks instead of real implementations
   - Cross-platform test validation incomplete
   - Edge case coverage insufficient
   - Limited test coverage for error conditions

## Next Major Features

1. **Plugin System Enhancement**
   - Plugin dependency resolution
   - Plugin ordering based on dependencies
   - Plugin conflict detection
   - Better error isolation in plugins

2. **Build System Improvements**
   - Incremental builds for faster rebuilds
   - Asset fingerprinting and caching
   - Parallel processing for content transformation
   - Memory usage optimization

3. **Fullstack Features Expansion**
   - WebSocket support for real-time applications
   - File upload handling
   - Session management
   - Authentication support

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Better error messaging and debugging
   - Visualization of build process and dependencies
   - Performance profiling tools
   - Configuration validation and suggestions
